Storegrill,"Biomass, an energy-producing source, is used principally in the form of firewood and charcoal.  Currently, biomass provides about 93% of Nigeriaâ€™s consumed energy source as firewood and charcoal.  Although Nigeria is an agricultural country with vast amounts of forests and trees, at the present time, the majority of its agricultural waste is not being fully utilized for the production of energy. The briquettes will be made out of charcoal-dust and dry agricultural wastes, sugar cane trash, and maize trash from farmers. Simple technologies will be implemented to make it less expensive to produce briquettes.  Thus, the briquettes will be affordable by the local population. Briquettes have a high bulk density compared to fire wood and loose biomass. Because of their density and low moisture content, the briquettes give  a longer burning time which will translate to cost savings for the customer.",Online Marketplace where you buy and sell different products at affordable prices,"E-Commerce, Mobile Commerce, Online Shopping, Online Marketplaces",Nigeria
